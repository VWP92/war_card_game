# war_card_game
War Card game written in Cpp

I'm fairly new to programming languages so to practice I started writing this on 6/23/2017 using Visual Studio 2017. The purpose was I wanted to make the War card game in Cpp using objects and vectors so that the cards can be handled in code as just like they are handled in real life.

I will be wanting to add more features to this....Don't know what yet lol.
