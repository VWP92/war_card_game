# war_card_game
War Card game written in Cpp

I'm fairly new to programming languages so to practice I started writing this on 6/23/2017 using Visual Studio 2017 as a Win32Console Application. The purpose was I wanted to make the War card game in Cpp using objects and vectors.
I will be wanting to add more features to this....Don't know what yet.
